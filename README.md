# game-llm
A really small project used for my bachelor thesis to test the strength of small LLM's a game NPC and game god.
Up till now the movement is set by me for testing the collisions and stuff.
The project is made using python and pygame-ce library, free assets from itch.io and other sites and Tiled to construct
the maps and create object collisions.
Things done:\n 
-Collisions\n
-player's animations loading\n
-maps loading\n

Things to do:
-at least one more map for now
-llm integration and dialogues
-get good collisions when scaling the window
