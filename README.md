# game-llm
A really small project used for my bachelor thesis to test the strength of small LLM's a game NPC and game god.
Up till now the movement is set by me for testing the collisions and stuff.
The project is made using python and pygame-ce library, free assets from itch.io and other sites and Tiled to construct
the maps and create object collisions.
Things done:
-Collisions
-Tilemap's, player's animations loading
