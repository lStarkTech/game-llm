# game-llm
A really small project used for my bachelor thesis to test the strength of small LLM used as a game NPC and game god.
Up till now the movement is set by me for testing the collisions and debugging in general.
The project is made using python and pygame-ce library, some assets from itch.io and Tiled to construct
the maps, create object collisions and other stuff.
Things done:  
-Collisions  
-player's animations loading  
-maps loading  

Things to do:  
-at least one more map for now  
-llm integration and dialogues
-get good collisions when scaling the window
